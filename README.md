# DORSAL_ADFA-LD
# A Benchmark of Unsupervised Off-The-Shelf Anomaly Detection Methods on ADFA-LD

This a internship project realized on the ADFA-LD dataset in Python 3. 
This project tests several unsuppervised machine learning and deep learning methods to perform outlier detection on traces. 

# ADFA-LD

The ADFA-LD dataset can be found on : https://github.com/verazuo/a-labelled-version-of-the-ADFA-LD-dataset

# Representations

The representations of the data used in this project are: 
* Bag of Word
* Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
* Laten Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
* Skipgram (Word2vec)

# Outlier Detection Methods

The outlier detection methods used in this project are:
* Cosine Similarity
* k Nearest Neighbour (k-NN)
* Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN)
* Isolation Forest 
* One Class Support Vector Model (One Class SVM)
